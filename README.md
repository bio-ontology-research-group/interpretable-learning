# Interpretable learning on knowledge bases

## Experiments

Our aim was to generate interpretable rules from biological knowledge bases, mainly using algorithms comming from probabilistic logic programming.

We evaluate first order logic decision trees (TILDE) and probabilistic logic programs (Markov logic, Bayesian logic).

Implementations we tried include a Python implementation of TILDE (in this repo), LoMRF (a Scala implementation of
Markov logic, https://anskarl.github.io/LoMRF/), ProbCog (Python implementation of Markov logic and Bayesian logic, https://github.com/opcode81/ProbCog).
